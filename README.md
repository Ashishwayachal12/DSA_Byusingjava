# DSA in Java

This repository contains implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java. Each topic is covered with clear and structured code examples to help understand core concepts and their applications.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized by different DSA topics, with each topic in a separate folder under the `src` directory:

- **src/Arrays**: Basic array operations, searching, sorting, and manipulation techniques.
- **src/LinkedLists**: Singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked list implementations.
- **src/Stacks**: Stack implementation using arrays and linked lists, and related algorithms.
- **src/Queues**: Queue, circular queue, and priority queue with various operations.
- **src/Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and heap implementations.
- **src/Graphs**: Graph traversal techniques like BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms, and more.
- **src/SortingAlgorithms**: Sorting techniques like quicksort, mergesort, bubblesort, etc.
- **src/SearchingAlgorithms**: Binary search, linear search, and more.
- **src/DynamicProgramming**: Problems like knapsack, longest common subsequence, etc.
- **src/Recursion**: Solving problems using recursive approaches.
- **src/GreedyAlgorithms**: Greedy strategies for problem-solving, including Huffman encoding.
- Add more topics as necessary...

## Requirements

- **Java**: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version X or later).
- **IDE**: Any Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans is recommended.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
  
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-java.git](https://github.com/Ashishwayachal12/DSA-full-code-)


 2. Navigate to the desired topic folder inside src/, and compile the Java files using your preferred IDE or the command line:
    
        javac ClassName.java
3. Run the compiled Java program
  
       java ClassName
